# Team Roles
  Business analyst (BA)
      Understands customer’s business processes
      Translates customer business needs into requirements
    A business analyst dives deep into a customer’s workflows and analyzes stakeholder feedback to help clients formulate their wants and align a customer’s vision with what a development team is producing. They translate an abstract product idea into a set of tangible requirements.

  Product owner (PO)
      Holds responsibility for a product vision and evolution
      Makes sure the final product meets customer requirements
    Holding more responsibility for a product’s success than any other development team member, a product owner is a decision-maker. Balancing both business needs and market trends, they define a business strategy, shape up the product vision, make sure it satisfies customer needs, and manage a product backlog. Associated mainly with flexible Agile environments, a product owner is particularly useful in scenarios where requirements and workflows frequently change.

The responsibilities of a BA and a PO sound quite similar. What’s the difference between the two, and is there a need for both in one project?

The critical difference is that a product owner provides the vision of a product without diving deep into how it is technically implemented, while a business analyst bridges the gap between a customer and a team, being a bit more on the technical side. So, a PO is more customer-oriented, while a BA is often more focused on the technicalities of the project. Professional business analysts are usually qualified to take over some of a product owner’s tasks, like managing the product backlog and modeling workflows, among other responsibilities.

In outsourcing scenarios, a product owner can be someone from the client’s side, a startup founder, for example. They possess deep domain expertise but might lack technical knowledge. They can work in tandem with business analysts to fine-tune product requirements.

# Technology Stack
1. Django
Purpose: Django is a high-level Python web framework used for building web applications rapidly.

In a project: It helps developers build RESTful APIs or full-stack web apps, handling everything from URL routing to database models and user authentication.

2. PostgreSQL
Purpose: PostgreSQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).

In a project: It stores and manages structured data (like user records, sensor data, logs), and integrates well with Django via libraries like psycopg2.

3. GraphQL
Purpose: GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries.

In a project: It allows clients (like front-end apps) to fetch only the data they need, making APIs faster and more flexible compared to traditional REST APIs.

# Feature Breakdown
1. User Management
 Description: This feature handles user registration, authentication, and role-based access (e.g., host or guest). It ensures secure access to the platform and provides personalized experiences based on user roles.

2. Property Management
Description: Hosts can list, update, and delete property listings, including uploading images and setting prices. This feature is essential for creating an inventory of rentable spaces and giving hosts control over their offerings.

3. Booking System
Description: Guests can view availability, select check-in/check-out dates, and book properties. This core feature facilitates the main functionality of the platform—reserving accommodations.

4. Review and Rating System
Description: After a stay, users can leave reviews and ratings for properties. This builds trust in the community by allowing guests to share experiences and helping future users make informed decisions.

5. Payment Integration
Description: Secure handling of payments, including processing, confirmation, and status tracking. This enables real transactions, making the booking process complete and functional.

6. API Development (REST/GraphQL)
Description: APIs allow frontend and mobile applications to communicate with the backend efficiently. They provide a structured way to access and manipulate data like users, bookings, and listings.

7. Security Features
Description: Includes password encryption, access control, and input validation to protect users and data. These measures are crucial for safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining platform integrity.

8. CI/CD Pipelines
Description: Automates testing, integration, and deployment of code changes. This feature improves development efficiency and ensures consistent updates without downtime.


# API Security
1. Authentication
Description: Securely verifies user identity through methods like email/password login or OAuth (e.g., Google).

Why it's important: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and ensures that actions (like bookings or payments) are tied to verified individuals.

2. Authorization
Description: Controls access to different parts of the system based on user roles (e.g., guest vs. host).

Why it's important: Ensures users can only perform actions they’re permitted to (e.g., guests can’t edit listings, hosts can’t view other hosts' earnings), reducing misuse or data exposure.

3. Password Hashing
Description: Encrypts user passwords using hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt or Argon2) before storing them.

Why it's important: Even if the database is breached, raw passwords are not exposed, protecting user login credentials.

4. Input Validation and Sanitization
Description: Cleans and verifies user input to prevent malicious code injection (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).

Why it's important: Blocks attackers from exploiting user input to manipulate databases or client-side scripts.

5. Rate Limiting and Throttling
Description: Limits the number of requests a user or IP can make in a set period.

Why it's important: Helps prevent brute force attacks, API abuse, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

6. Secure Payment Processing
Description: Integrates with trusted third-party payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) and uses HTTPS for all transactions.

Why it's important: Protects financial data and ensures the integrity and confidentiality of all monetary transactions.

7. HTTPS and SSL/TLS
Description: Encrypts all data transmitted between the client and server.

Why it's important: Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks, ensuring sensitive data like login details or payment info isn’t intercepted.

8. Audit Logging
Description: Records key user actions (e.g., login attempts, payment events).

Why it's important: Provides traceability in case of suspicious activity and supports security incident investigations.

# CI/CD Pipeline
What are CI/CD Pipelines?
CI/CD pipelines (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) are automated workflows that help developers integrate code changes, run tests, and deploy updates efficiently and reliably.

Continuous Integration (CI) ensures that every code change is automatically tested and merged into the shared codebase.

Continuous Deployment (CD) automates the release of these changes to staging or production environments.

Why CI/CD Is Important for This Project
For an Airbnb Clone, CI/CD pipelines:

Ensure reliable updates without breaking functionality (important for booking and payments).

Automate testing, reducing bugs and human error.

Speed up development cycles and streamline collaboration, especially in team environments.

Enable frequent, safe deployments, essential for real-world scalability and user trust.

Tools That Can Be Used
GitHub Actions – Automates tests, builds, and deployment from GitHub repositories.

Docker – Packages the app in containers to ensure consistency across development and production environments.

Jenkins – A customizable open-source CI/CD automation server.

Travis CI – Integrates easily with GitHub for automated testing and deployment.

Heroku/GitLab CI/CD – For streamlined deployment environments with built-in CI/CD support.
