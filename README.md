# Team Roles
  Business analyst (BA)
      Understands customer’s business processes
      Translates customer business needs into requirements
    A business analyst dives deep into a customer’s workflows and analyzes stakeholder feedback to help clients formulate their wants and align a customer’s vision with what a development team is producing. They translate an abstract product idea into a set of tangible requirements.

  Product owner (PO)
      Holds responsibility for a product vision and evolution
      Makes sure the final product meets customer requirements
    Holding more responsibility for a product’s success than any other development team member, a product owner is a decision-maker. Balancing both business needs and market trends, they define a business strategy, shape up the product vision, make sure it satisfies customer needs, and manage a product backlog. Associated mainly with flexible Agile environments, a product owner is particularly useful in scenarios where requirements and workflows frequently change.

The responsibilities of a BA and a PO sound quite similar. What’s the difference between the two, and is there a need for both in one project?

The critical difference is that a product owner provides the vision of a product without diving deep into how it is technically implemented, while a business analyst bridges the gap between a customer and a team, being a bit more on the technical side. So, a PO is more customer-oriented, while a BA is often more focused on the technicalities of the project. Professional business analysts are usually qualified to take over some of a product owner’s tasks, like managing the product backlog and modeling workflows, among other responsibilities.

In outsourcing scenarios, a product owner can be someone from the client’s side, a startup founder, for example. They possess deep domain expertise but might lack technical knowledge. They can work in tandem with business analysts to fine-tune product requirements.
